## Installation

The Ahoy library can be easily installed using Swift Package Manager. See the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) for instructions on adding a package to your project.

## Usage

To get started you need to initialize an instance of an Ahoy client. The initializer takes a configuration object, which requires you to provide a `baseUrl` as well as an `ApplicationEnvironment` object.
``` swift
import Ahoy

let ahoy: Ahoy = .init(
    configuration: .init(
    environment: .init(
        platform: UIDevice.current.systemName,
        appVersion: "1.0.2",
        osVersion: UIDevice.current.systemVersion
    ),
    baseUrl: URL(string: "https://your-server.com")!
)
```
### Configuration
The configuation object has intelligent defaults _(listed below in parens)_, but allows you to a to provide overrides for a series of values:
- visitDuration _(30 minutes)_
- urlRequestHandler _(`URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher`)_
- Routing
    - ahoyPath _("ahoy")_
    - visitsPath _("visits")_
    - eventsPath _("events")_

Beyond configuration, you can also provide your own `AhoyTokenManager` and `RequestInterceptor`s at initialization _(`requestInterceptors` can be modified later)_ for custom token management and pre-flight Ahoy request modifications, respectively.

### Tracking a visit
After your client is initialized â€” ensure you maintain a reference â€” you'll need to track a visit, typically done at application launch. If desired, you can pass custom data such as utm parameters, referrer, etc.

``` swift
ahoy.trackVisit()
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { _ in }, receiveOutput: { visit in  print(visit) })
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### Tracking events
After your client has successfully registered a visit, you can send begin to send events to your server.
``` swift
ahoy.track(events: [myFirstEvent, mySecondEvent])
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { _ in }, receiveOutput: { _ in })
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### Other goodies
To access the current visit directly, simply use your Ahoy client's `currentVisit` property. _(There is also a currentVisitPublisher you can listen to.)_ Additionally, you can use the `headers` property to add `Ahoy-Visitor` and `Ahoy-Visit` tokens to your own requests as needed.
